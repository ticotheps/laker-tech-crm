## Project Overview

Although adequate for the season in which it was used, the previous method of
device management during the 2020-2021 school year included data entry/retrieval
into multiple Google sheets. This caused much confusion & headache due to: too
many sources of 'truth', frequent user errors during data entry (i.e. -
duplicate entries, spelling errors, etc.), & lack of usability. 

The Laker Technology Department's CRM was built as the next iteration for device
management of Laker staff members'
and students' Chromebooks, iPads, & other devices. It aims to improve:
efficiency, usability, & data integrity.
