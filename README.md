## Project Overview

The previous method of device management for hundreds of Laker Elementary, Middle, & High School
students & staff during the 2020-2021 school year mainly consisted of data entry
and retrieval using multiple Google sheets. 

Although adequate for the seasons in which they were used, the Google sheet
record-keeping ended up causing much confusion & headache due to: 
- too many sources of 'truth'.
- frequent data entry errors (i.e. - misspelled names, inconsistency with casing, etc.).
- duplicate entries.
- missing entries.
- overall lack of ease with usability. 

This new CRM was designed and built to be the next improved-upon iteration for
device management during the 2021-2022 school year. Its aims are to improve:
- efficiency (i.e. - the ability to generate a list of students who have not
  returned loaned devices using a single click instead of taking 14 days) 
- usability (i.e. - devices can be checked-in/out in less than 60 seconds while
  maintaining high data integrity)
- extensibility (i.e. - designated Laker staff apart from the Technology
  department staff have the ability to check-in/out devices)
- data integrity (i.e. - zero duplicate entries).
